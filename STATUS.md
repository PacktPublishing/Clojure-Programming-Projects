# Chapters status

This is the status of the code base, for book content check CDP.

## Recent changes

- 27/07/2018 - Restarted project setup with Leiningen and no Docker.

Rationale: clj deps/cli tools and related utilities are really alpha quality as of today. It's impossible to recover the straightforward live coding flow we're used to with one single JVM process (needs three terminals!).

The repo contains code unrelated to the book that I want to reuse.

## TODO

- Port existing to new project setup
- Adjust main README
- Move out unrelated code
