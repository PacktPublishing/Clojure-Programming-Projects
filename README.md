# WIP: Packt Publishing - Clojure Programming Projects

## Pre-req

- sh/bash
- git
- atom
- chrome

## Clojure setup

[TODO]

Start a REPL session to check your clojure setup:

```bash
$ lein repl
```

## Editor setup

[TODO]

## Hack a project

[TODO] implement the scripts

Run the `chapters/<ch>/start.sh` script, where <ch> is the chapter number (01, 02, ...):
```bash
$ cd chapters/02
$ sh start.sh
```
This will checkout a fresh branch `ch02-wip` for you to work on. Do not merge it back into master!

## See a finished project

You can view and search the code for the completed project directly on GitHub, by switching to the banch `ch02-done` in the top left of the main repo page.

Or you can run the `chapters/<ch>/finish.sh` script, to checkout the finished project:
```bash
$ cd chapters/02
$ sh finish.sh
```
